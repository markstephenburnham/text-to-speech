Speaker 1:
Okay. Are you there?

Speaker 2:
Yeah.

Speaker 1:
Okay. This is funny. I feel like a journalist.

Speaker 2:
Yeah. You're getting into that realm I suppose.

Speaker 1:
It's very, very interesting. Okay. Well, thank you for doing this. So I gave you some potential topics of discussion. I was thinking we could keep this to 10 or 15 minutes, even though I know we can go on probably for longer.

Speaker 2:
Yeah, I think we could probably talk about each point for well over that.

Speaker 1:
Yeah.

Speaker 2:
So maybe we start at the first point and see where it goes? If it's interesting enough?
